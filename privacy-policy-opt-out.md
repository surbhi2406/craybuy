  the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide
  is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the application, you are visiting.
  That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of
  these sites via a link from the application's homepage, you should contact the application
  or website owners directly for more information. When we present information to
  our advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of
  advertising on our websites or Applications -- it is usually in the form of aggregated
  statistics on traffic to various pages / content within our websites or Applications.
  We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our websites

  without your consent.\nINFORMATION SHARING\nCRAYBUY shares the sensitive personal
  information to any third party without obtaining the prior consent of the User in
  the following limited circumstances:\na) When it is requested or required by law
  or by any court or governmental agency or authority to disclose, for the purpose
  of verification of identity, or for the prevention, detection, investigation including
  cyber incidents, or for prosecution and punishment of offences. These disclosures
  are made in good faith and belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary for

  purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested
  to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may
  decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require
  disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be
  extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on
  backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where
  we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge,
  except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we
  maintain certain services, after you delete your information, residual copies may
  take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain
  in our backup systems.\nINFORMATION SECURITY\nWe take appropriate security measures
  to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure
  or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage

  we store personal data.\nAll information gathered on CRAYBUY is securely stored
  within the CRAYBUY controlled database. The database is stored on servers secured

  you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.
  And, of course, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas
  is available to anyone with Internet access.\nHowever the internet is an ever evolving
  medium. We may change our privacy policy from time to time to incorporate necessary
  future changes. Of course, our use of any information we gather will always be consistent
